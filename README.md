## Note
I made this in 1 day and I only have 1 years of experience, feel free to critique my spaghetti of a code.

# passmaker

passmaker is a program to make an encrypted password based on the current domain for the password and the original password.
This is just a password tool that I make just for fun and the sake of my fascination.
Might not be perfect, use it on your own risk.

It's a simple one, there's a possibility for me to develop this program.
(might be one for linux!)

## Compilation

Compile the source code with your trusty c++ compiler.

```bash
g++ ./src/pass.cpp
```

## Usage

```bash
./<the_program>.exe

./<the_program>.exe -m<your_main_password_here>
```
"-m" option is used to write/replace your main password (optional, if you already placed your main password).

The resulting password will be put in your clipboard.
